 * load→save windows can overlap and one increment would be lost.
 *
 * Reuses the shared acquireLock/releaseLock (update.ts), which records the owner
 * PID and reclaims a stale lock whose owner process is gone — so a crashed
 * detached judge cannot orphan the lock forever. If the lock genuinely cannot be
 * taken within the retry budget (a live peer is mid-write), we SKIP `fn` and log
 * it rather than racing unlocked. Be honest about the consequence: a skipped
 * increment writes NO delta, so it is simply dropped — it does NOT reconcile on
 * the next pull. That is an accepted tradeoff (an upvote is a best-effort
 * statistical signal, and the retry budget makes exhaustion rare) and is far
 * cheaper than the corruption a lost/overlapping write would cause. Returns
